Specifically, we do not give any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and/or non-infringement. We do not make any promises that access to the Site, any of the Services, or any of the materials contained therein, will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or error-free.<br><br>If you have a dispute with one or more users of the Company, you agree that neither we nor our affiliates or service providers, nor any of our respective officers, directors, merchants, agents, joint venturers, employees and representatives, will be liable for any claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential, direct or indirect) of any kind or nature arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.<br><br>We are not liable for any breach of the Agreement, including delays, failure in performance or interruption of service, where they arise directly or indirectly from abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which would have been unavoidable despite all effects to the contrary, nor are we liable where the breach is due to the application of mandatory legal rules.<br><br><strong>DISCLAIMER OF NO WARRANTY</strong><br>The Company and its affiliates make no representation or warranty about the services, including any representation that the services will be uninterrupted or error-free, and provide the services (including content and information) on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the Company and its affiliates disclaim any implied or statutory warranty, including any implied warranty of title, accuracy of data, non-infringement, or merchantability of fitness for a particular purpose.<br><br>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, COMPANY ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF ANY CONTENT; (II) PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICE; (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN; (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SERVICE; (V) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE SERVICE BY ANY THIRD PARTY; (VI) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE; AND/OR (VII) THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY.<br><br><strong>ENGAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE</strong><br>To assess users' comprehension of and engagement with our products and services, as well as to gauge their readiness for future innovations, it is required that users complete all product cycles before initiating a withdrawal request. Withdrawals cannot be processed mid-cycle, nor can any product interactions be canceled, skipped, or reversed, due to binding agreements with our merchant partners. Our system experiences frequent updates, with products being added and removed every minute, and prolonged holding of a product by a user can adversely affect merchant progress. Users are encouraged to complete their product cycles and submit withdrawal requests within a timeframe of 24 to 48 hours. In the event that a product is retained for longer than the specified 48-hour period, our terms of service provide for adjustments to the standard payment schedules based on mutual agreement between the user and our company. Should such adjustments occur, nominal fees may be levied to cover the administrative costs associated with these changes and to ensure continuous service provision. Details regarding these fees are included within the billing adjustments section of our user agreements, promoting transparency and aiding comprehension. This approach allows us to flexibly respond to our users’ varying financial situations while safeguarding the efficiency and progress of our merchant partners. Additionally, the Company may request further documentation to verify the authenticity of the funds involved. Users may also be asked to demonstrate the origin of these funds. Should there be any concerns regarding the legitimacy of the funds, the Company reserves the right to conduct an audit of the user's account. This comprehensive approach helps ensure that all financial interactions within our platform adhere to the highest standards of security and compliance. To maintain compliance and ensure clarity in transactional flows, each account shall operates with distinct payer information, except in the case of coach accounts.<br><br><strong>SUSPENSION, TERMINATION, AND CANCELLATION</strong><br>We may: (a) suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the Company Services, and/or (c) deactivate or cancel your Account with immediate effect for good reason, including, but not limited to where:<br><br>a. We are required by a governmental authority to do so;<br>b. You are, or appear to be, unable to meet your obligations in respect of one or more duties;<br>c. You are subject to an insolvency event of any type (as determined in our absolute discretion);<br>d. Any investigation, claim, action or proceeding of any nature is commenced against you (including without limitation investigation into suspected market abuse, manipulation or other criminal conduct), you have breached Applicable Laws or steps are taken by any person to enforce any security interest against you;<br>e. You are in breach of this Agreement; or<br>f. We otherwise feel it is necessary in order to protect us or the Company.<br>If we suspend, restrict or close your Account, and / or terminate your use of Services, we will (unless it would be unlawful for us to do so) provide you with notice of our actions and the reasons for refusal, suspension or closure, and where appropriate, with the procedure for correcting any factual errors that led to the refusal, suspension or closure of your Account.<br>We may terminate or suspend or cancel your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, if you breach the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the service will immediately cease.<br><br><strong>OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</strong><br>a.

You shall not, copy, reproduce, download, \"screen scrape\", store, transmit, broadcast, publish, modify, create a derivative work from, display, perform, distribute, redistribute, sell, license, rent, lease or otherwise use, transfer (either in printed, electronic or other format) or exploit any Content, in whole or in part, in any way that does not comply with these Terms.<br><br>b.

When destroying your personal information, we will take commercially reasonable measures to make your personal information irrecoverable or irreproducible in accordance with the applicable law.<br><br><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>How we use your personal information will depend on which services you use, how you use those services, and the choices you make in your settings. We use the information that we have about you to provide and personalize our services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our services (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others.<br><br><strong>COOKIE AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</strong><br>As further described in our Cookie Policy, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off, and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy.<br><br><strong>SECURITY</strong><br>We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS.

      "content": "At the Company, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you. This cookie policy applies to any the Company product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage, and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as cookies\") to collect and use data as part of our services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (\"Services\"), which includes our sites, communications, mobile applications, and off-site services, such as our ad services and the \"Apply with the Company\" and \"Share with the Company\" plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use these technologies.<br>By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in this policy.<br><br><strong>WHAT TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED</strong><br><br><strong>COOKIES</strong><br>Cookies are small text files containing a string of characters that can be placed on your computer or mobile device, which uniquely identify your browser or device. We may use technologies such as cookies, pixels, and local storage to deliver, secure, and understand products, services, and ads. We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing member, so it's easier to return to the Company and interact with our services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by the Company when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).<br><br><strong>PIXELS</strong><br>A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser.<br><br><strong>LOCAL STORAGE</strong><br>Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the Company experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences, and speeding up site functionality.<br><br><strong>WHAT ARE THESE TECHNOLOGIES USED FOR AUTHENTICATION</strong><br>We use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our services. If you're signed into the Company, these technologies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience in line with your settings. For example, cookies enable the Company to identify you and verify your account.<br><br><strong>SECURITY</strong><br>We use cookies and similar technologies to make your interactions with our services faster and more secure. For example, we use cookies to enable and support our security features, keep your account safe, and help us detect malicious activity and violations of our User Agreement.<br><br><strong>PREFERENCES, FEATURES AND SERVICES</strong><br>We use cookies and similar technologies to enable the functionality of our services, such as helping you fill out forms on our services more easily and providing you with features, insights, and customized content in conjunction with our plugins. We also use these technologies to remember information about your browser and your preferences.<br><br><strong>BROWSER CONTROLS</strong><br>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of cookies. Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including the Company cookies. To learn more about browser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.<br><br><strong>HOW CAN YOU CONTROL COOKIES?</strong><br>To learn more about the choices that advertisers provide generally for individuals to influence how information about their online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services is collected and used, visit the Network Advertising Initiative at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info/, or the European Digital Advertising Alliance at http://youronlinechoices.eu/. In addition, your browser or device may offer settings that allow you to choose whether browser cookies are set and to delete them. These controls vary by browser and manufacturers may change both the settings they make available and how they work at any time. As of 23 June 2021, you may find additional information about the controls offered by popular browsers at the links below. Certain parts of the Company products may not work properly if you have disabled browser cookie use."

Links to third sites</strong><br>The Portal may include links to pages or websites of third parties not related to the Portal. The Portal does not assume any responsibility for these links or the contents that can be accessed through them, as it does not approve or review their functions, advertising, or in general the information included in these pages, and disclaims any liability for their content and their correct operation, or any consequences or damage that may occur as a result of accessing them. Users who access any of these links do so at their own risk, accepting the external nature of these contents and the inability of BRANDVIOUS, INC. to guarantee that there are no threats, malware or viruses, illegal content, or other links that in turn lead to sites with one or more of said characteristics.<br><br><strong>6. Exclusion of Liability</strong><br>The Portal works to ensure that the services and functionalities of the Portal are always available. However, on access to the Portal, it will be shown \"as-is\", according to the availability and limitations in place at any time. Despite the Company's continuous efforts to protect the systems and content included in the Portal, for which purpose it uses the common security standards on the Internet, it is not possible to offer full guarantees about the intrusions or loss of information that may take place. Similarly, there is no guarantee of the absence of viruses or other harmful elements in the Portal or in third-party websites that may produce software and hardware changes in the user's computer system. The user therefore assumes and understands that there are situations that may be beyond the control of the Company. The Company does not accept any liability that may derive from the misuse of the Portal by the user, or for the breach of obligations or commitments assumed under these General Conditions of Use, or any other conditions that may be applicable. In general, neither the Company nor its collaborators may be held liable in case of loss of earnings or actual loss for any reason.<br><br><strong>7. Indemnity</strong><br>The Company suffers any type of damage, losses, or costs (including lawyers' and court representatives' fees) as a result of a breach by the users of these General Conditions of Use, or any other conditions applicable, the user shall be obliged to compensate the Company. This will also be the case if as a result of a breach by the user claims are made by third parties against the Company, in which case the third party shall hold the Company harmless, and the Company may claim against the user any expenses, costs or damages derived from its actions.<br><br><strong>8. Data protection and security risks</strong><br>The collection of personal data through the Company and its treatment by the Company is regulated by a specific Privacy Policy to which the candidates may have access by viewing.<br><br><strong>9. General matters</strong><br>9.1. Safeguard and interpretation<br>These General Conditions of Use constitute an agreement between you as user and the Portal. If the competent authority declares any provision to be illegal, invalid or not enforceable, this provision must be interpreted in the way that is closest to its original intent. Such a declaration with respect to one or more of the clauses shall not affect the validity of the remaining ones. If the Company does not comply strictly with one of the terms of these Conditions, it does not constitute, nor in any case may it be interpreted to be, a waiver of a possible demand for compliance in the future.<br><br>9.2. Legislation and jurisdiction<br>Relations between the Portal and the user shall be governed by the United States law, and in case of disagreement with respect to the interpretation of or compliance with these General Conditions of Use, they expressly renounce any other jurisdiction that may correspond to them, and subject themselves to the courts, unless any other jurisdiction is determined by imperative law.<br><br><strong>CERTIFICATE</strong><br>Registered Entity Name: BRANDVIOUS, INC<br>Registered Address: 11184 Antioch Rd.
